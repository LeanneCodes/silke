## FAQ

### Why should I care about the effect weather has on my hair?

Understanding the relationship between weather, dew points, and hair styling is crucial for maintaining healthy and beautiful textured hair. Dew points, humidity, and temperature can all impact how well your hair maintains a silk press.

### How does weather impact the longevity of a silk press?

Weather conditions, particularly humidity and dew point, can significantly affect a silk press. High humidity and high dew points can cause hair to absorb moisture from the air, leading to frizz and reversion to its natural texture.

### What is dew point, and why is it important for a silk press?

Dew point is the temperature at which air becomes saturated with moisture and dew forms. Itâ€™s crucial for a silk press because when the dew point is high, there is more moisture in the air, which can cause the hair to swell and revert back to curls or waves.

### How does high humidity affect a silk press?

High humidity means there is a lot of moisture in the air, which can cause hair to absorb this moisture. This leads to swelling of the hair shaft, frizz, and eventually, the hair reverting to its natural curl pattern, thus shortening the longevity of a silk press.
